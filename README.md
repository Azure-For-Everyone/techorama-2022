## 1. Throw the dice

Before you can get started hacking the challenge, you first need to throw the dice. The resulting eyes will tell you which challenge (1-6) you need to solve.

## 2. Open the exercise

Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/Azure-For-Everyone/techorama-2022` , and make a pull request. Open the directory with Visual Studio Code (or your favourite IDE) and install the libraries using `npm install`.

## 3. Solve the challenge

Look into the `app` folder of your exercise, and try running the `npm test` command in your terminal. Ooooh oooh, things don't work, go and fix it ;).

## 4. You have fixed it

Once you confirm `npm test` is working properly you can commit your fix and related pull request (PR). Your PR will trigger a Github action, and related Azure DevOps pipeline. Once the pipeline is done and succeeded, you will be granted a pair of cool sunglasses, a coin, and most importantly an unique chance to trigger the lottery machine.

## 5. The ultimate price

If you are so lucky and you got 3 symbols displayed you will win a Surface Headphones or a free examn voucher.
