# Exercise 3

Farming has evolved over the years and now is a high-tech business. Coming from horses we are now farming with highly expensive and complex machines.

An important aspect in farming is to use the right tools to complete the job. The type and size of land, will determine whats the best equipment to leverage. Some machines are more suitable for 1are, others are better for 1hectare. So bottom line knowing how big your land is will help you picking up the right tool. 

But hey, how do you properly calculate the size of a land.. Can you help?

# The challenge

Within this project `app` folder you will find a `size.js`. In this file you will find three  functions: `getSquares`, `getAres` and `getHectares`. Those functions will help you to calculate the size of land in different metrics. Try running the `npm test` command in the terminal to see if the converter is working as expected.

# The problem

As you might have noticed, something is not working, and that is REALLY annoying. I bet something is going wrong in the `getSquares` and `getHectares` function, but not sure ;). Can you help solving this issue?
