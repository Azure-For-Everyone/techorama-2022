# Exercise 1

When developing webapps or websites, we like to have a good looking and clean design. To achieve this, the concept of styling through CSS is an important aspect in creating a sleek user experience (UX). 

When styling on the web we can use different color formats such as RGB (Red Green Blue) colors and HEX (Hexadecimal) colors. RGB and HEX colors can be used alternately, which means that each RGB color can be represented as a HEX color and vice versa.

## The challenge

Within this project `app` folder you will find a `converter.js` file. In this file you will find a `rgbToHex` function that is responsible for transforming a RGB color to a HEX color. Try running the `npm test` command in the terminal to see if the converter is working as expected.

## The problem

As you might have noticed, something is not working, and that is REALLY annoying. I bet something is going wrong in the `pad` function, but not sure ;). Can you help solving this issue?
